# HomeFy

HomeFy is a real estate app that aims to connect homeowners who are looking to rent out their properties with potential renters. The app has two user ends, one for normal users and one for homeowners.

### Features

- Normal users can see rental posts from homeowners and contact them through various means such as email, call, or messaging by creating a user account.
- Homeowners can store information about their properties, including bills, renter information, and make monthly bill invoices for renters.
- The app stores this information in a database and sends instant SMS to renters' contact numbers.
- Homeowners can view graphical representations of their property information and assign a manager to manage their dashboard if they have multiple properties.
